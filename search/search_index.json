You typically want to use an aggregate hydrator when you want to hydrate or extract data from complex objects that implement multiple interfaces, and therefore need multiple hydrators to handle that in subsequent steps. Installation requirements The AggregateHydrator depends on the laminas-eventmanager component, so be sure to have it installed before getting started: $ composer require laminas/laminas-eventmanager Basic usage A simple use case may be hydrating a BlogPost object, which contains data for the user that created it, the time it was created, the current publishing status, etc: use Laminas\\Hydrator\\Aggregate\\AggregateHydrator; $hydrator = new AggregateHydrator(); // attach the various hydrators capable of handling simpler interfaces $hydrator-&gt;add(new My\\BlogPostHydrator()); $hydrator-&gt;add(new My\\UserAwareObjectHydrator()); $hydrator-&gt;add(new My\\TimestampedObjectHydrator()); $hydrator-&gt;add(new My\\PublishableObjectHydrator()); // ... // Now retrieve the BlogPost object // ... // you can now extract complex data from a blogpost $data = $hydrator-&gt;extract($blogPost); // or you can fill the object with complex data $blogPost = $hydrator-&gt;hydrate($data, $blogPost); Hydrator priorities AggregateHydrator::add has a second optional argument, $priority . If you have two or more hydrators that conflict with each other for same data keys, you may decide which one to execute first or last by passing a higher or lower integer priority, respectively, to this argument. In order to work with this logic, each of the hydrators that are attached should ignore any unknown object type passed in: namespace My; use Laminas\\Hydrator\\HydratorInterface class BlogPostHydrator implements HydratorInterface { public function hydrate($data, $object) { if (! $object instanceof BlogPost) { return $object; } // ... continue hydration ... } public function extract($object) { if (! $object instanceof BlogPost) { return array(); } // ... continue extraction ... } } Advanced use cases Since the AggregateHydrator is event-driven, you can use the EventManager API to tweak its behaviour. Common use cases include: Removal of hydrated data keys (passwords/confidential information) depending on business rules. Caching of the hydration/extraction process. Transformations on extracted data, for compatibility with third-party APIs. In the following example, a cache listener is introduced to speed up hydration, which can be very useful when the same data is requested multiple times: use Laminas\\Hydrator\\Aggregate\\AggregateHydrator; use Laminas\\Hydrator\\Aggregate\\ExtractEvent; use Laminas\\Cache\\Storage\\Adapter\\Memory; $hydrator = new AggregateHydrator(); // Attach the various hydrators: $hydrator-&gt;add(new My\\BlogPostHydrator()); $hydrator-&gt;add(new My\\UserAwareObjectHydrator()); $hydrator-&gt;add(new My\\TimestampedObjectHydrator()); $hydrator-&gt;add(new My\\PublishableObjectHydrator()); // ... $cache = new Memory(); $cacheReadListener = function (ExtractEvent $event) use ($cache) { $object = $event-&gt;getExtractionObject(); if (! $object instanceof BlogPost) { return; } if ($cache-&gt;hasItem($object-&gt;getId())) { $event-&gt;setExtractedData($cache-&gt;getItem($object-&gt;getId())); $event-&gt;stopPropagation(); } }; $cacheWriteListener = function (ExtractEvent $event) use ($cache) { $object = $event-&gt;getExtractionObject(); if (! $object instanceof BlogPost) { return; } $cache-&gt;setItem($object-&gt;getId(), $event-&gt;getExtractedData()); }; // Attaching a high priority listener executed before extraction logic: $eventManager = $hydrator-&gt;getEventManager(); $eventManager()-&gt;attach(ExtractEvent::EVENT_EXTRACT, $cacheReadListener, 1000); // Attaching a low priority listener executed after extraction logic: $eventManager()-&gt;attach(ExtractEvent::EVENT_EXTRACT, $cacheWriteListener, -1000); With an aggregate hydrator configured in this way, any $hydrator-&gt;extract($blogPost) operation will be cached.","title":"Aggregates"},{"location":"v2/aggregate/#aggregatehydrator","text":"Laminas\\Hydrator\\Aggregate\\AggregateHydrator is an implementation of Laminas\\Hydrator\\HydratorInterface that composes multiple hydrators via event listeners.

This is especially useful, if you want to omit some internals (e.g. getServiceManager() ) from the array representation. It comes with a helpful Composite implementation, and several filters for common use cases. The filters are composed in the AbstractHydrator , so you can start using them immediately in any custom extensions you write that extend that class. namespace Laminas\\Hydrator\\Filter; interface FilterInterface { /** * Should return true, if the given filter * does not match * * @param string $property The name of the property * @return bool */ public function filter($property); } If it returns true, the key/value pairs will be in the extracted arrays - if it returns false, you'll not see them again. Filter implementations Laminas\\Hydrator\\Filter\\GetFilter This filter is used in the ClassMethods hydrator to decide which getters will be extracted. It checks if the key to extract starts with get or the object contains a method beginning with get (e.g., Laminas\\Foo\\Bar::getFoo ). Laminas\\Hydrator\\Filter\\HasFilter This filter is used in the ClassMethods hydrator to decide which has methods will be extracted. It checks if the key to extract begins with has or the object contains a method beginning with has (e.g., Laminas\\Foo\\Bar::hasFoo ). Laminas\\Hydrator\\Filter\\IsFilter This filter is used in the ClassMethods hydrator to decide which is methods will be extracted. It checks if the key to extract begins with is or the object contains a method beginning with is (e.g., Laminas\\Foo\\Bar::isFoo ). Laminas\\Hydrator\\Filter\\MethodMatchFilter This filter allows you to omit methods during extraction that match the condition defined in the composite. The name of the method is specified in the constructor of this filter; the second parameter decides whether to use white or blacklisting to decide (whitelisting retains only the matching method, blacklist omits any matching method). The default is blacklisting - pass false to change the behavior. Laminas\\Hydrator\\Filter\\NumberOfParameterFilter This filter is used in the ClassMethods hydrator to check the number of parameters. By convention, the get , has and is methods do not get any parameters - but it may happen. You can add your own number of required parameters, simply add the number to the constructor. The default value is 0. If the method has more or fewer parameters than what the filter accepts, it will be omitted. Remove filters If you want to tell e.g. the ClassMethods hydrator, to not extract methods that start with is , remove the related filter: $hydrator = new ClassMethods(false); $hydrator-&gt;removeFilter('is'); After performing the above, the key/value pairs for is methods will not end up in your extracted array anymore. The filters can be used in any hydrator, but the ClassMethods hydrator is the only one, that has pre-registered filters: $this-&gt;filterComposite-&gt;addFilter('is', new IsFilter()); $this-&gt;filterComposite-&gt;addFilter('has', new HasFilter()); $this-&gt;filterComposite-&gt;addFilter('get', new GetFilter()); $this-&gt;filterComposite-&gt;addFilter( 'parameter', new NumberOfParameterFilter(), FilterComposite::CONDITION_AND ); If these are not appropriate for your object, you can unregister them as shown in the previous example. Add filters You can add filters to any hydrator that extends the AbstractHydrator . Filters can either implement FilterInterface , or simply be PHP callables: $hydrator-&gt;addFilter('len', function($property) { if (strlen($property) !== 3) { return false; } return true; }); By default, every filter you add will be added with a conditional or . If you want to add it with and (as the NumberOfParameterFilter that is added to the ClassMethods hydrator by default), provide the conditon as the third argument to addFilter : $hydrator-&gt;addFilter('len', function($property) { if (strlen($property) !== 3) { return false; } return true; }, FilterComposite::CONDITION_AND); One common use case for filters is to omit getters for values that you do not want to represent, such as a service manager instance: $hydrator-&gt;addFilter( 'servicemanager', new MethodMatchFilter('getServiceManager'), FilterComposite::CONDITION_AND ); The example above will exclude the getServiceManager() method and the servicemanager key from extraction, even if the get filter wants to add it. Use FilterComposite for complex filters FilterComposite implements FilterInterface as well, so you can add it as a regular filter to the hydrator. One benefit of this implementation is that you can add the filters with a condition and accomplish complex requirements using different composites with different conditions. You can pass the following conditions to the 3rd parameter, when you add a filter: Laminas\\Hydrator\\Filter\\FilterComposite::CONDITION_OR At the given level of the composite, at least one filter in that condition block has to return true to extract the value. Laminas\\Hydrator\\Filter\\FilterComposite::CONDITION_AND At the given level of the composite, all filters in that condition block must return true to extract the value. FilterComposite Examples This composition will have a similar logic as the if below: $composite = new FilterComposite(); $composite-&gt;addFilter('one', $condition1); $composite-&gt;addFilter('two', $condition2); $composite-&gt;addFilter('three', $condition3); $composite-&gt;addFilter('four', $condition4, FilterComposite::CONDITION_AND); $composite-&gt;addFilter('five', $condition5, FilterComposite::CONDITION_AND); // This is what's happening internally if ( ($condition1 || $condition2 || $condition3 ) &amp;&amp; ($condition4 &amp;&amp; $condition5 ) ) { //do extraction } If you only have one condition (e.g., only an and or or ) block, the other one will be completely ignored. A bit more complex filter can look like this: $composite = new FilterComposite(); $composite-&gt;addFilter( 'servicemanager', new MethodMatchFilter('getServiceManager'), FilterComposite::CONDITION_AND ); $composite-&gt;addFilter( 'eventmanager', new MethodMatchFilter('getEventManager'), FilterComposite::CONDITION_AND ); $hydrator-&gt;addFilter('excludes', $composite, FilterComposite::CONDITION_AND); // Internal if (( // default composite inside the hydrator ($getFilter || $hasFilter || $isFilter ) &amp;&amp; ( $numberOfParameterFilter ) ) &amp;&amp; ( // new composite, added to the one above $serviceManagerFilter &amp;&amp; $eventManagerFilter ) ) { // do extraction } If you perform this on the ClassMethods hydrator, all getters will get extracted, except for getServiceManager() and getEventManager() . Using the provider interface FilterProviderInterface allows you to configure the behavior of the hydrator inside your objects. namespace Laminas\\Hydrator\\Filter; interface FilterProviderInterface { /** * Provides a filter for hydration * * @return FilterInterface */ public function getFilter(); } (The getFilter() method is automatically excluded from extract() .) If the extracted object implements the Laminas\\Hydrator\\Filter\\FilterProviderInterface , the returned FilterInterface instance can also be a FilterComposite . For example: Class Foo implements FilterProviderInterface { public function getFoo() { return 'foo'; } public function hasFoo() { return true; } public function getServiceManager() { return 'servicemanager'; } public function getEventManager() { return 'eventmanager'; } public function getFilter() { $composite = new FilterComposite(); $composite-&gt;addFilter('get', new GetFilter()); $exclusionComposite = new FilterComposite(); $exclusionComposite-&gt;addFilter( 'servicemanager', new MethodMatchFilter('getServiceManager'), FilterComposite::CONDITION_AND ); $exclusionComposite-&gt;addFilter( 'eventmanager', new MethodMatchFilter('getEventManager'), FilterComposite::CONDITION_AND ); $composite-&gt;addFilter('excludes', $exclusionComposite, FilterComposite::CONDITION_AND); return $composite; } } $hydrator = new ClassMethods(false); $extractedArray = $hydrator-&gt;extract(new Foo()); $extractedArray will only have 'foo' =&gt; 'foo'; all other values are excluded from extraction.

Objects must implement either the exchangeArray() or populate() methods to support hydration, and the getArrayCopy() method to support extraction. Laminas\\Hydrator\\ClassMethods Any data key matching a setter method will be called in order to hydrate; any method matching a getter method will be called for extraction.

This is the interface that needs to be implemented: namespace Laminas\\Hydrator\\Strategy; interface StrategyInterface { /** * Converts the given value so that it can be extracted by the hydrator. * * @param mixed $value The original value. * @return mixed Returns the value that should be extracted. */ public function extract($value); /** * Converts the given value so that it can be hydrated by the hydrator. * * @param mixed $value The original value. * @return mixed Returns the value that should be hydrated. */ public function hydrate($value); } This interface is similar to Laminas\\Hydrator\\HydratorInterface ; the reason is that strategies provide a proxy implementation for hydrate() and extract() . Adding strategies to the hydrators To allow strategies within your hydrator, Laminas\\Hydrator\\Strategy\\StrategyEnabledInterface provides the following methods: namespace Laminas\\Hydrator; use Laminas\\Hydrator\\Strategy\\StrategyInterface; interface StrategyEnabledInterface { /** * Adds the given strategy under the given name. * * @param string $name The name of the strategy to register. * @param StrategyInterface $strategy The strategy to register. * @return HydratorInterface */ public function addStrategy($name, StrategyInterface $strategy); /** * Gets the strategy with the given name. * * @param string $name The name of the strategy to get. * @return StrategyInterface */ public function getStrategy($name); /** * Checks if the strategy with the given name exists. * * @param string $name The name of the strategy to check for. * @return bool */ public function hasStrategy($name); /** * Removes the strategy with the given name. * * @param string $name The name of the strategy to remove. * @return HydratorInterface */ public function removeStrategy($name); } Every hydrator shipped by default provides this functionality; AbstractHydrator fully implements it as well. As such, if you want to use this functionality in your own hydrators, you should extend AbstractHydrator . Available implementations Laminas\\Hydrator\\Strategy\\BooleanStrategy This strategy converts values into Booleans and vice versa. It expects two arguments at the constructor, which are used to define value maps for true and false . Laminas\\Hydrator\\Strategy\\ClosureStrategy This is a strategy that allows you to pass in options for: hydrate , a callback to be called when hydrating a value, and extract , a callback to be called when extracting a value. Laminas\\Hydrator\\Strategy\\DateTimeFormatterStrategy DateTimeFormatterStrategy provides bidirectional conversion between strings and DateTime instances. The input and output formats can be provided as constructor arguments. As of version 2.4.1, this strategy now allows DateTime formats that use ! to prepend the format, or | or + to append it; these ensure that, during hydration, the new DateTime instance created will set the time element accordingly. As a specific example, Y-m-d| will drop the time component, ensuring comparisons are based on a midnight time value. Laminas\\Hydrator\\Strategy\\DefaultStrategy The DefaultStrategy simply proxies everything through, without performing any conversion of values. Laminas\\Hydrator\\Strategy\\ExplodeStrategy This strategy is a wrapper around PHP's implode() and explode() functions. The delimiter and a limit can be provided to the constructor; the limit will only be used for extract operations. Laminas\\Hydrator\\Strategy\\SerializableStrategy SerializableStrategy provides the functionality backing Laminas\\Hydrator\\ArraySerializable . You can use it with custom implementations for Laminas\\Serializer\\Adapter\\AdapterInterface if you want to as well. Laminas\\Hydrator\\Strategy\\StrategyChain This strategy takes an array of StrategyInterface instances and iterates over them when performing extract() and hydrate() operations. Each operates on the return value of the previous, allowing complex operations based on smaller, single-purpose strategies. Writing custom strategies The following example, while not terribly useful, will provide you with the basics for writing your own strategies, as well as provide ideas as to where and when to use them. This strategy simply transforms the value for the defined key using str_rot13() during both the extract() and hydrate() operations: class Rot13Strategy implements StrategyInterface { public function extract($value) { return str_rot13($value); } public function hydrate($value) { return str_rot13($value); } } This is the example class with which we want to use the hydrator example: class Foo { protected $foo = null; protected $bar = null; public function getFoo() { return $this-&gt;foo; } public function setFoo($foo) { $this-&gt;foo = $foo; } public function getBar() { return $this-&gt;bar; } public function setBar($bar) { $this-&gt;bar = $bar; } } Now, we'll add the rot13 strategy to the method getFoo() and setFoo($foo) : $foo = new Foo(); $foo-&gt;setFoo('bar'); $foo-&gt;setBar('foo'); $hydrator = new ClassMethods(); $hydrator-&gt;addStrategy('foo', new Rot13Strategy()); When you use the hydrator to extract an array for the object $foo , you'll receive the following: $extractedArray = $hydrator-&gt;extract($foo); // array(2) { // [\"foo\"]=&gt; // string(3) \"one\" // [\"bar\"]=&gt; // string(3) \"foo\" // } And when hydrating a new Foo instance: $hydrator-&gt;hydrate($extractedArray, $foo) // object(Foo)#2 (2) { // [\"foo\":protected]=&gt; // string(3) \"bar\" // [\"bar\":protected]=&gt; // string(3) \"foo\" // }","title":"Strategies"},{"location":"v2/strategy/#laminashydratorstrategy","text":"You can add Laminas\\Hydrator\\Strategy\\StrategyInterface to any of the hydrators (except if it extends Laminas\\Hydrator\\AbstractHydrator or implements Laminas\\Hydrator\\HydratorInterface and Laminas\\Hydrator\\Strategy\\StrategyEnabledInterface ) to manipulate the way how they behave on extract() and hydrate() for specific key / value pairs.

You typically want to use an aggregate hydrator when you want to hydrate or extract data from complex objects that implement multiple interfaces, and therefore need multiple hydrators to handle that in subsequent steps. Installation requirements The AggregateHydrator depends on the laminas-eventmanager component, so be sure to have it installed before getting started: $ composer require laminas/laminas-eventmanager Basic usage A simple use case may be hydrating a BlogPost object, which contains data for the user that created it, the time it was created, the current publishing status, etc: use Laminas\\Hydrator\\Aggregate\\AggregateHydrator; $hydrator = new AggregateHydrator(); // attach the various hydrators capable of handling simpler interfaces $hydrator-&gt;add(new My\\BlogPostHydrator()); $hydrator-&gt;add(new My\\UserAwareObjectHydrator()); $hydrator-&gt;add(new My\\TimestampedObjectHydrator()); $hydrator-&gt;add(new My\\PublishableObjectHydrator()); // ... // Now retrieve the BlogPost object // ... // you can now extract complex data from a blogpost $data = $hydrator-&gt;extract($blogPost); // or you can fill the object with complex data $blogPost = $hydrator-&gt;hydrate($data, $blogPost); Hydrator priorities AggregateHydrator::add has a second optional argument, $priority . If you have two or more hydrators that conflict with each other for same data keys, you may decide which one to execute first or last by passing a higher or lower integer priority, respectively, to this argument. In order to work with this logic, each of the hydrators that are attached should ignore any unknown object type passed in: namespace My; use Laminas\\Hydrator\\HydratorInterface class BlogPostHydrator implements HydratorInterface { public function hydrate($data, $object) { if (! $object instanceof BlogPost) { return $object; } // ... continue hydration ... } public function extract($object) { if (! $object instanceof BlogPost) { return array(); } // ... continue extraction ... } } Advanced use cases Since the AggregateHydrator is event-driven, you can use the EventManager API to tweak its behaviour. Common use cases include: Removal of hydrated data keys (passwords/confidential information) depending on business rules. Caching of the hydration/extraction process. Transformations on extracted data, for compatibility with third-party APIs. In the following example, a cache listener is introduced to speed up hydration, which can be very useful when the same data is requested multiple times: use Laminas\\Hydrator\\Aggregate\\AggregateHydrator; use Laminas\\Hydrator\\Aggregate\\ExtractEvent; use Laminas\\Cache\\Storage\\Adapter\\Memory; $hydrator = new AggregateHydrator(); // Attach the various hydrators: $hydrator-&gt;add(new My\\BlogPostHydrator()); $hydrator-&gt;add(new My\\UserAwareObjectHydrator()); $hydrator-&gt;add(new My\\TimestampedObjectHydrator()); $hydrator-&gt;add(new My\\PublishableObjectHydrator()); // ... $cache = new Memory(); $cacheReadListener = function (ExtractEvent $event) use ($cache) { $object = $event-&gt;getExtractionObject(); if (! $object instanceof BlogPost) { return; } if ($cache-&gt;hasItem($object-&gt;getId())) { $event-&gt;setExtractedData($cache-&gt;getItem($object-&gt;getId())); $event-&gt;stopPropagation(); } }; $cacheWriteListener = function (ExtractEvent $event) use ($cache) { $object = $event-&gt;getExtractionObject(); if (! $object instanceof BlogPost) { return; } $cache-&gt;setItem($object-&gt;getId(), $event-&gt;getExtractedData()); }; // Attaching a high priority listener executed before extraction logic: $eventManager = $hydrator-&gt;getEventManager(); $eventManager()-&gt;attach(ExtractEvent::EVENT_EXTRACT, $cacheReadListener, 1000); // Attaching a low priority listener executed after extraction logic: $eventManager()-&gt;attach(ExtractEvent::EVENT_EXTRACT, $cacheWriteListener, -1000); With an aggregate hydrator configured in this way, any $hydrator-&gt;extract($blogPost) operation will be cached.","title":"Aggregates"},{"location":"v3/aggregate/#aggregatehydrator","text":"Laminas\\Hydrator\\Aggregate\\AggregateHydrator is an implementation of Laminas\\Hydrator\\HydratorInterface that composes multiple hydrators via event listeners.

This is especially useful, if you want to omit some internals (e.g. getServiceManager() ) from the array representation. It comes with a helpful Composite implementation, and several filters for common use cases. The filters are composed in the AbstractHydrator , so you can start using them immediately in any custom extensions you write that extend that class. namespace Laminas\\Hydrator\\Filter; interface FilterInterface { /** * Should return true, if the given filter does not match. */ public function filter(string $property) : bool; } If it returns true, the key/value pairs will be in the extracted arrays - if it returns false, you'll not see them again. Filter implementations Laminas\\Hydrator\\Filter\\GetFilter This filter is used in the ClassMethodsHydrator to decide which getters will be extracted. It checks if the key to extract starts with get or the object contains a method beginning with get (e.g., Laminas\\Foo\\Bar::getFoo ). Laminas\\Hydrator\\Filter\\HasFilter This filter is used in the ClassMethodsHydrator to decide which has methods will be extracted. It checks if the key to extract begins with has or the object contains a method beginning with has (e.g., Laminas\\Foo\\Bar::hasFoo ). Laminas\\Hydrator\\Filter\\IsFilter This filter is used in the ClassMethodsHydrator to decide which is methods will be extracted. It checks if the key to extract begins with is or the object contains a method beginning with is (e.g., Laminas\\Foo\\Bar::isFoo ). Laminas\\Hydrator\\Filter\\MethodMatchFilter This filter allows you to omit methods during extraction that match the condition defined in the composite. The name of the method is specified in the constructor of this filter; the second parameter decides whether to use white or blacklisting to decide (whitelisting retains only the matching method, blacklist omits any matching method). The default is blacklisting - pass false to change the behavior. Laminas\\Hydrator\\Filter\\NumberOfParameterFilter This filter is used in the ClassMethodsHydrator to check the number of parameters. By convention, the get , has and is methods do not get any parameters - but it may happen. You can add your own number of required parameters, simply add the number to the constructor. The default value is 0. If the method has more or fewer parameters than what the filter accepts, it will be omitted. Use FilterComposite for complex filters FilterComposite implements FilterInterface as well, so you can add it as a regular filter to the hydrator. One benefit of this implementation is that you can add the filters with a condition and accomplish complex requirements using different filters with different conditions. You can pass the following conditions to the 3rd parameter, when you add a filter: Laminas\\Hydrator\\Filter\\FilterComposite::CONDITION_OR At the given level of the composite, at least one filter set using CONDITION_OR must return true to extract the value. Laminas\\Hydrator\\Filter\\FilterComposite::CONDITION_AND At the given level of the composite, all filters set using CONDITION_AND must return true to extract the value. FilterComposite Examples To illustrate how conditions apply when composing filters, consider the following set of filters: $composite = new FilterComposite(); $composite-&gt;addFilter('one', $condition1); $composite-&gt;addFilter('two', $condition2); $composite-&gt;addFilter('three', $condition3); $composite-&gt;addFilter('four', $condition4, FilterComposite::CONDITION_AND); $composite-&gt;addFilter('five', $condition5, FilterComposite::CONDITION_AND); The above is roughly equivalent to the following conditional: // This is what's happening internally if ( ($condition1 || $condition2 || $condition3 ) &amp;&amp; ($condition4 &amp;&amp; $condition5 ) ) { // do extraction } If you only have one condition block (e.g., only AND or OR filters), the other condition type will be completely ignored. A bit more complex filter can look like this: $composite = new FilterComposite(); $composite-&gt;addFilter( 'servicemanager', new MethodMatchFilter('getServiceManager'), FilterComposite::CONDITION_AND ); $composite-&gt;addFilter( 'eventmanager', new MethodMatchFilter('getEventManager'), FilterComposite::CONDITION_AND ); $hydrator-&gt;addFilter('excludes', $composite, FilterComposite::CONDITION_AND); // Internal if (( // default composite inside the ClassMethodsHydrator: ($getFilter || $hasFilter || $isFilter ) &amp;&amp; ( $numberOfParameterFilter ) ) &amp;&amp; ( // new composite, added to the one above $serviceManagerFilter &amp;&amp; $eventManagerFilter ) ) { // do extraction } If you perform this on the ClassMethodsHydrator , all getters will get extracted, except for getServiceManager() and getEventManager() . Using the provider interface Laminas\\Hydrator\\Filter\\FilterProviderInterface allows you to configure the behavior of the hydrator inside your objects. namespace Laminas\\Hydrator\\Filter; interface FilterProviderInterface { /** * Provides a filter for hydration * * @return FilterInterface */ public function getFilter(); } (The getFilter() method is automatically excluded from extract() .) If the extracted object implements the Laminas\\Hydrator\\Filter\\FilterProviderInterface , the returned FilterInterface instance can also be a FilterComposite . For example: Class Foo implements FilterProviderInterface { public function getFoo() { return 'foo'; } public function hasFoo() { return true; } public function getServiceManager() { return 'servicemanager'; } public function getEventManager() { return 'eventmanager'; } public function getFilter() { $composite = new FilterComposite(); $composite-&gt;addFilter('get', new GetFilter()); $exclusionComposite = new FilterComposite(); $exclusionComposite-&gt;addFilter( 'servicemanager', new MethodMatchFilter('getServiceManager'), FilterComposite::CONDITION_AND ); $exclusionComposite-&gt;addFilter( 'eventmanager', new MethodMatchFilter('getEventManager'), FilterComposite::CONDITION_AND ); $composite-&gt;addFilter('excludes', $exclusionComposite, FilterComposite::CONDITION_AND); return $composite; } } $hydrator = new ClassMethodsHydrator(false); $extractedArray = $hydrator-&gt;extract(new Foo()); $extractedArray will only have 'foo' =&gt; 'foo'; all other values are excluded from extraction. Note All pre-registered filters from the ClassMethodsHydrator hydrator are ignored when this interface is used. More on those methods below. Filter-enabled hydrators and the composite filter Hydrators can indicate they are filter-enabled by implementing Laminas\\Hydrator\\Filter\\FilterEnabledInterface : namespace Laminas\\Hydrator\\Filter; interface FilterEnabledInterface extends FilterProviderInterface { /** * Add a new filter to take care of what needs to be hydrated. * To exclude e.g. the method getServiceLocator: * * &lt;code&gt; * $composite-&gt;addFilter( * \"servicelocator\", * function ($property) { * [$class, $method] = explode('::', $property, 2); * return $method !== 'getServiceLocator'; * }, * FilterComposite::CONDITION_AND * ); * &lt;/code&gt; * * @param string $name Index in the composite * @param callable|FilterInterface $filter */ public function addFilter(string $name, $filter, int $condition = FilterComposite::CONDITION_OR) : void; /** * Check whether a specific filter exists at key $name or not * * @param string $name Index in the composite */ public function hasFilter(string $name) : bool; /** * Remove a filter from the composition. * * To not extract \"has\" methods, you simply need to unregister it * * &lt;code&gt; * $filterComposite-&gt;removeFilter('has'); * &lt;/code&gt; */ public function removeFilter(string $name) : void; } Note that the interface extends FilterProviderInterface , which means it also includes the getFilter() method. The FilterEnabledInterface makes the assumption that the class will be backed by a Laminas\\Hydrator\\Filter\\FilterComposite ; the various addFilter() , hasFilter() , and removeFilter() methods are expected to proxy to a FilterComposite instance. AbstractHydrator , on which all the hydrators shipped in this package are built, implements FilterEnabledInterface . Of the hydrators shipped, only one, ClassMethodsHydrator , defines any filters from the outset. Its constructor includes the following: $this-&gt;filterComposite-&gt;addFilter('is', new IsFilter()); $this-&gt;filterComposite-&gt;addFilter('has', new HasFilter()); $this-&gt;filterComposite-&gt;addFilter('get', new GetFilter()); $this-&gt;filterComposite-&gt;addFilter( 'parameter', new NumberOfParameterFilter(), FilterComposite::CONDITION_AND ); Remove filters If you want to tell a filter-enabled hydrator such as ClassMethodsHydrator not to extract methods that start with is , remove the related filter: $hydrator = new ClassMethodsHydrator(false); $hydrator-&gt;removeFilter('is'); After performing the above, the key/value pairs for is methods will no longer end up in your extracted array. Add filters You can add filters using the addFilter() method. Filters can either implement FilterInterface , or simply be PHP callables: $hydrator-&gt;addFilter('len', function($property) { return strlen($property) === 3; }); By default, every filter you add will be added with a conditional OR . If you want to add it with AND (such as the ClassMethodsHydrator does with its composed NumberOfParameterFilter , demonstrated above) provide the conditon as the third argument to addFilter : $hydrator-&gt;addFilter('len', function($property) { return strlen($property) === 3; }, FilterComposite::CONDITION_AND); One common use case for filters is to omit getters for values that you do not want to represent, such as a service manager instance: $hydrator-&gt;addFilter( 'servicemanager', new MethodMatchFilter('getServiceManager'), FilterComposite::CONDITION_AND ); The example above will exclude the getServiceManager() method and the servicemanager key from extraction, even if the get filter wants to add it.","title":"Filters"},{"location":"v3/filter/#laminashydratorfilter","text":"Hydrator filters allow you to manipulate the behavior of the extract() operation. This is especially useful, if you want to omit some internals (e.g. getServiceManager() ) from the array representation.

Minimum supported versions PHP Version 3 bumps the minimum supported PHP version to version 7.2.

MapNamingStrategy merged ArrayMapNamingStrategy and MapNamingStrategy were performing essentially the same duties, but in reverse. As such, for version 3, we have merged the two into MapNamingStrategy . To accommodate the three different use cases, we provide three \"named constructors\": public static function createFromExtractionMap(array $extractionMap) : MapNamingStrategy; public static function createFromHydrationMap(array $hydrationMap) : MapNamingStrategy; public static function createFromAsymmetricMap(array $extractionMap, array $hydrationMap) : MapNamingStrategy; In the first two cases, the constructor will flip the arrays for purposes of the opposite interaction; e.g., using createFromExtractionMap() will create a hydration map based on an array_flip() of the extraction map provided. You MUST use one of these methods to create an instance, as the constructor is now marked private . HydratorPluginManager This version removes support for laminas-servicemanager v2 service names. Under laminas-servicemanager v2, most special characters were removed, and the name normalized to all lowercase. Now, only fully qualified class names are mapped to factories, and short names (names omitting the namespace and/or \"Hydrator\" suffix) are mapped as aliases. Additionally, version 3 ships a standalone, PSR-11 compliant version, Laminas\\Hydrator\\StandaloneHydratorPluginManager . By default, the HydratorManager service alias will point to the StandaloneHydratorPluginManager if laminas-servicemanager is not installed, and the HydratorPluginManager otherwise.

HydratorPluginManager If you have used laminas-hydrator prior to version 3, you are likely already familiar with this class, as it has been the implementation we have shipped from initial versions.

It defines short-name aliases for all shipped hydrators (the class name minus the namespace), in a variety of casing combinations. All but the DelegatingHydrator are defined as invokable services (meaning they can be instantiated without any constructor arguments).

The component contains concrete implementations for a number of common use cases, such as by using arrays, object methods, and reflection, and provides interfaces for creating custom implementations. Basic Usage Hydrating an Object To hydrate an object with data, instantiate the hydrator and then pass to it the data for hydrating the object. $hydrator = new Laminas\\Hydrator\\ArraySerializableHydrator(); $data = [ 'first_name' =&gt; 'James', 'last_name' =&gt; 'Kahn', 'email_address' =&gt; 'james.kahn@example.org', 'phone_number' =&gt; '+61 419 1234 5678', ]; $object = $hydrator-&gt;hydrate($data, new ArrayObject()); Extracting Values From an Object To extract data from an object, instantiate the applicable hydrator and then call extract , passing to it the object to extract data from. $hydrator = new Laminas\\Hydrator\\ArraySerializableHydrator(); // ... Assuming that $object has already been initialised $data = $hydrator-&gt;extract($object); Available Implementations ArraySerializableHydrator The ArraySerializableHydrator hydrates data from an array and extracts an object’s data returning it as an array. Objects passed to the hydrate method must implement either exchangeArray() or populate() to support hydration, and must implement getArrayCopy() to support extraction. ClassMethodsHydrator The ClassMethodsHydrator calls \"setter\" methods matching keys in the data set to hydrate objects and calls \"getter\" methods matching keys in the data set during extraction, based on the following rules: is*() , has*() , and get*() methods will be used when extracting data. The method prefix will be removed from the key's name. set*() methods will be used when hydrating properties. class User { private $firstName; private $lastName; private $emailAddress; private $phoneNumber; public function setFirstName(string $firstName) { $this-&gt;firstName = $firstName; } public function setLastName(string $lastName) { $this-&gt;lastName = $lastName; } public function setEmailAddress(string $emailAddress) { $this-&gt;emailAddress = $emailAddress; } public function setPhoneNumber(string $phoneNumber) { $this-&gt;phoneNumber = $phoneNumber; } } $data = [ 'first_name' =&gt; 'James', 'last_name' =&gt; 'Kahn', 'email_address' =&gt; 'james.kahn@example.org', 'phone_number' =&gt; '+61 419 1234 5678', ]; $hydrator = new Laminas\\Hydrator\\ClassMethodsHydrator(); $user = $hydrator-&gt;hydrate($data, new User()); $data = $hydrator-&gt;extract(new User()); ObjectPropertyHydrator The ObjectPropertyHydrator hydrates objects and extracts data using publicly accessible properties which match a key in the data set. class User { private $firstName; private $lastName; private $emailAddress; private $phoneNumber; } $data = [ 'first_name' =&gt; 'James', 'last_name' =&gt; 'Kahn', 'email_address' =&gt; 'james.kahn@example.org', 'phone_number' =&gt; '+61 419 1234 5678', ]; $hydrator = new Laminas\\Hydrator\\ObjectPropertyHydrator(); $user = $hydrator-&gt;hydrate($data, new User()); $data = $hydrator-&gt;extract(new User()); ReflectionHydrator The ReflectionHydrator is similar to the ObjectPropertyHydrator , however it uses PHP's reflection API to hydrate or extract properties of any visibility. Any data key matching an existing property will be hydrated. Any existing properties will be used for extracting data. class User { private $firstName; private $lastName; private $emailAddress; private $phoneNumber; } $data = [ 'first_name' =&gt; 'James', 'last_name' =&gt; 'Kahn', 'email_address' =&gt; 'james.kahn@example.org', 'phone_number' =&gt; '+61 419 1234 5678', ]; $hydrator = new Laminas\\Hydrator\\ReflectionHydrator(); $user = $hydrator-&gt;hydrate($data, new User()); $data = $hydrator-&gt;extract(new User()); DelegatingHydrator The DelegatingHydrator composes a hydrator locator, and will delegate hydrate() and extract() calls to the appropriate one based upon the class name of the object being operated on. // Instantiate each hydrator you wish to delegate to $albumHydrator = new Laminas\\Hydrator\\ClassMethodsHydrator(); $artistHydrator = new Laminas\\Hydrator\\ClassMethodsHydrator(); // Map the entity class name to the hydrator using the HydratorPluginManager. // In this case we have two entity classes, \"Album\" and \"Artist\". $hydrators = new Laminas\\Hydrator\\HydratorPluginManager; $hydrators-&gt;setService('Album', $albumHydrator); $hydrators-&gt;setService('Artist', $artistHydrator); // Create the DelegatingHydrator and tell it to use our configured hydrator locator $delegating = new Laminas\\Hydrator\\DelegatingHydrator($hydrators); // Now we can use $delegating to hydrate or extract any supported object // Assumes that $data and Artist have already been initialised $array = $delegating-&gt;extract(new Artist()); $artist = $delegating-&gt;hydrate($data, new Artist());","title":"Quick Start"},{"location":"v3/quick-start/#quick-start","text":"The laminas-hydrator component provides functionality for hydrating objects (which is the act of populating an object from a set of data) and extracting data from them.

For this reason, their return types are listed as mixed, versus as array and object , respectively. Adding strategies to the hydrators This package provides the interface Laminas\\Hydrator\\Strategy\\StrategyEnabledInterface . Hydrators can implement this interface, and then call on its getStrategy() method in order to extract or hydrate individual values. The interface has the following definition: namespace Laminas\\Hydrator\\Strategy; interface StrategyEnabledInterface { /** * Adds the given strategy under the given name. */ public function addStrategy(string $name, StrategyInterface $strategy) : void; /** * Gets the strategy with the given name. */ public function getStrategy(string $name) : StrategyInterface; /** * Checks if the strategy with the given name exists. */ public function hasStrategy(string $name) : bool; /** * Removes the strategy with the given name. */ public function removeStrategy(string $name) : void; } We provide a default implementation of the interface as part of Laminas\\Hydrator\\AbstractHydrator ; it uses an array property to store and retrieve strategies by name when extracting and hydrating values. Since all shipped hydrators are based on AbstractHydrator , they share these capabilities. Additionally, the functionality that consumes strategies within AbstractHydrator also contains checks if a naming strategy is composed, and, if present, will use it to translate the property name prior to looking up a strategy for it. Available implementations Laminas\\Hydrator\\Strategy\\BooleanStrategy This strategy converts values into Booleans and vice versa. It expects two arguments at the constructor, which are used to define value maps for true and false . Laminas\\Hydrator\\Strategy\\ClosureStrategy This is a strategy that allows you to pass in options for: hydrate , a callback to be called when hydrating a value, and extract , a callback to be called when extracting a value. Laminas\\Hydrator\\Strategy\\DateTimeFormatterStrategy DateTimeFormatterStrategy provides bidirectional conversion between strings and DateTime instances. The input and output formats can be provided as constructor arguments. The strategy allows DateTime formats that use ! to prepend the format, or | or + to append it; these ensure that, during hydration, the new DateTime instance created will set the time element accordingly. As a specific example, Y-m-d| will drop the time component, ensuring comparisons are based on a midnight time value. Starting in version 3.0, the constructor defines a third, optional argument, $dateTimeFallback . If enabled and hydration fails, the given string is parsed by the DateTime constructor, as demonstrated below: // Previous behavior: $strategy = new Laminas\\Hydrator\\Strategy\\DateTimeFormatterStrategy('Y-m-d H:i:s.uP'); $hydrated1 = $strategy-&gt;hydrate('2016-03-04 10:29:40.123456+01'); // Format is the same; returns DateTime instance $hydrated2 = $strategy-&gt;hydrate('2016-03-04 10:29:40+01'); // Format is different; value is not hydrated // Using new $dateTimeFallback flag; both values are hydrated: $strategy = new Laminas\\Hydrator\\Strategy\\DateTimeFormatterStrategy('Y-m-d H:i:s.uP', null, true); $hydrated1 = $strategy-&gt;hydrate('2016-03-04 10:29:40.123456+01'); $hydrated2 = $strategy-&gt;hydrate('2016-03-04 10:29:40+01'); Laminas\\Hydrator\\Strategy\\DefaultStrategy The DefaultStrategy simply proxies everything through, without performing any conversion of values. Laminas\\Hydrator\\Strategy\\ExplodeStrategy This strategy is a wrapper around PHP's implode() and explode() functions. The delimiter and a limit can be provided to the constructor; the limit will only be used for extract operations. Laminas\\Hydrator\\Strategy\\StrategyChain This strategy takes an array of StrategyInterface instances and iterates over them when performing extract() and hydrate() operations. Each operates on the return value of the previous, allowing complex operations based on smaller, single-purpose strategies. Writing custom strategies The following example, while not terribly useful, will provide you with the basics for writing your own strategies, as well as provide ideas as to where and when to use them. This strategy simply transforms the value for the defined key using str_rot13() during both the extract() and hydrate() operations: class Rot13Strategy implements StrategyInterface { public function extract($value) { return str_rot13($value); } public function hydrate($value) { return str_rot13($value); } } This is the example class with which we want to use the hydrator example: class Foo { protected $foo = null; protected $bar = null; public function getFoo() { return $this-&gt;foo; } public function setFoo($foo) { $this-&gt;foo = $foo; } public function getBar() { return $this-&gt;bar; } public function setBar($bar) { $this-&gt;bar = $bar; } } Now, we'll add the rot13 strategy to the method getFoo() and setFoo($foo) : $foo = new Foo(); $foo-&gt;setFoo('bar'); $foo-&gt;setBar('foo'); $hydrator = new ClassMethodsHydrator(); $hydrator-&gt;addStrategy('foo', new Rot13Strategy()); When you use the hydrator to extract an array for the object $foo , you'll receive the following: $extractedArray = $hydrator-&gt;extract($foo); // array(2) { // [\"foo\"]=&gt; // string(3) \"one\" // [\"bar\"]=&gt; // string(3) \"foo\" // } And when hydrating a new Foo instance: $hydrator-&gt;hydrate($extractedArray, $foo) // object(Foo)#2 (2) { // [\"foo\":protected]=&gt; // string(3) \"bar\" // [\"bar\":protected]=&gt; // string(3) \"foo\" // }","title":"Introduction"},{"location":"v3/strategy/#introduction","text":"You can compose Laminas\\Hydrator\\Strategy\\StrategyInterface instances in any of the hydrators to manipulate the way they behave on extract() and hydrate() for specific key/value pairs.
